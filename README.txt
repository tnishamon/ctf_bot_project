Hello, I am Matthew and I am making a discord bot. For now it hates Dylan. Later on, it will hate everyone.


Getting started: 
Reach out to the lead developer and GitHub manager (me, tnishamon) to get Discord token secrets! 

1. Make sure you have python installed in Bash: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/

2. Run the install script with ./install.sh

3. Run source myenv/bin/activate to get into venv, then run pip install -r requirements.txt to get dependencies (this list will grow so keep it on hand). You will probably need to update pip, but this is optional.

4. Run and develop on python venv to keep things consistent (we are using Python3.9.5) with source myenv/bin/activate (this will be created with install.sh)
    -deactivate will exit venv

5. I would recommend creating your own .env file and getting the token secret from me. Format for the file should just simply be:
    > DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="token here"

6. Have fun!
